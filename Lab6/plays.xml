    <synopsis>What happens when a simple woman like “Neerja” emotions dares to look for love outside her marriage from a man who is fearless and full of life “Abhay”. Love though, is not a simple word, as their story proceeds it takes us through an unimaginable complexity of unsaid emotions where Reality merely becomes an imagination of memories. Love is seen in yet another shade where it does survive the harsh realities of life but looses it self to the inner demons of the soul.</synopsis>
