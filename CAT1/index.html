                        In the southern tip of India, you’ll find the city of Mysore. Once the capital of the Wodeyar
                        dynasty, Mysore is best known for housing the magnificent Mysore Palace. The palace is the
                        epitome
                        of opulence, and a tour through the structure will reveal upscale touches like carved rosewood
                        doors, ceilings decorated in ivory and countless paintings on the walls.

                        If you’re in Mysore, you won’t want to miss the incredible Devaraja Market, an outdoor

                        Dhanwanthri Road where you can buy some chai tea and then browse stalls offering produce or

                        In the northern province of Punjab is Amritsar, a holy city and a mecca for the Sikh religion.
                        The
                        main attraction in Amritsar is the Golden Temple, also known as the Harmandir Sahib. Built more
                        than
                        400 years ago, this temple truly is golden, and it is always packed with Sikhs visiting from
                        around
                        India and the rest of the world.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can tour the Golden Temple regardless of religion, but you will need to show respect by
                        covering
                        your head and removing your shoes. Enter the temple through the Ghanta Ghar, the main entrance,
                        and
                        admire the Amrit Sarovar, a pool surrounding the temple where pilgrims bathe.

                        In northernmost India, in the heavily disputed Kashmir region, is the mountainous destination of
                        Ladakh. This region is large, but it has a low population density and a number of nomadic
                        residents.
                        Breathtaking, pristine scenery is a major draw to the area, but virtually all travelers will
                        also
                        spend time in the town of Leh.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The town is located at a very high elevation, and it is also home to the 17th century Palace of
                        the
                        King of Ladakh. Buddhist culture is also prominent in Leh, and you may wish to explore some of
                        the
                        many Buddhist monasteries and temples in the Old Town.

                        On the western coast of India is Goa, a former colony of Portugal that blends Indian culture
                        with
                        colonial influences and plenty of international tourism. Goa is popular largely because of its
                        spectacular beaches.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The busiest and most popular of all is Candolim Beach, where travelers from around the world
                        flock
                        to soak up the sun. Anjuna Beach, by contrast, is far less crowded. It is also an amazing place
                        where you can walk to Chapora Fort and admire the sandy coastline from a new perspective.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Palolem is considered one of the most beautiful beaches in all of Goa with it’s natural bay
                        surrounded by lofty headlands on either sides. Goa is widely loved by adventurers, and
                        recreational
                        activities are plentiful for those eager for some fun in the sun.

                        If you’re spending any time in Northern India, you will almost certainly visit the capital city
                        of
                        Delhi. The enormous sprawling destination is home to several districts, and it is considered to
                        be
                        one of the oldest cities in the world. One of the top sights in Delhi is the Red Fort, or Lal
                        Qila,
                        which was built in the 17th century.

                    <p>
                        The Red Fort is made from sandstone, and you will be able to walk through its Lahore Gate, into
                        the
                        bazaar, through the jewel palace and even into the former residence of the sultan. While in
                        Delhi,
                        you should also make time for the many museums and religious structures that make up the city.

                        In the state of Maharashtra, you can explore the caves of both Ellora and Ajanta. At Ellora,
                        there
                        is an enormous complex of shrines carved from the rocky landscape. These 34 cave shrines are up
                        to
                        1,500 years old, and they are from three distinct religions: Buddhism, Jainism and Hinduism.

                        Two hours away is Ajanta, which is also home to 29 caves. The Ajanta caves are covered in murals
                        and
                        paintings, most of which reflect Buddhist stories. While the two cave complexes are two hours

                    <p>
                        With a history dating back to more than 3,000 years, Varanasi is one of the world’s oldest
                        living
                        cities. Located in North India on the banks of the River Ganges, Varanasi has been an important
                        center of learning for ages as well as a chief pilgrimage destination for many Hindus.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Varanasi is regarded as a sacred city among Hindus, Jains and Buddhists because it is believed
                        that
                        dying here releases a person’s soul from the cycle of reincarnation, and that bathing in the
                        River
                        Ganges cleanses one’s sins.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Varanasi offers sights and experiences unknown anywhere else in the world. It is nicknamed the
                        “City
                        of Temples” because of its thousands of temples. Some of the most significant are the Kashi
                        Vishwanath Temple of Shiva, the Durga Temple and the Sankat Mochan Hanuman Temple, which is
                        known
                        for housing numerous monkeys.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Probably the most famous sites of the city are the ghats, the series of embankment steps leading
                        down to the Ganges River, where many people gather to bathe. The oldest and main ghat is the
                        Dashashwamedh Ghat. The Manikarnika Ghat is a burning ghat where Hindu cremations and rituals of
                        death anniversaries are frequently held. Yoga, shaves and massages are other activities
                        available
                        here. The best way to see the ghats is by taking a morning boat ride at sunrise.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Silk weaving is popular in Varanasi, and there are scores of shops and markets selling silk
                        products
                        like sarees and scarves in addition to other handicrafts.

                        The southwestern state of India known as Kerala is a place of tropical beauty. Palm trees, white
                        sand beaches and eco-tourism are all big reasons to explore the region. Besides its famous
                        backwaters, elegant houseboats and temple festivals, Kerala is also home to Thekkady, a tiger
                        preserve which allows you to admire flora and fauna without crowds.

                        The hub of Kerala is the city of Kochi, where you can see the local fishing industry thriving
                        along
                        with modern high-rises and colonial architecture. Kochi is ethnically and religiously diverse,
                        and
                        in a single afternoon you can explore a Jewish synagogue, a Dutch palace, the Portuguese

                        Agra is one of the most-visited cities in all of India. Once the capital of the Mughal Empire,
                        Agra
                        is now home to the iconic structure known as the Taj Mahal. The white marble mausoleum was built
                        in
                        the 17th century, and it is widely regarded as a monument of love.

                        While spectacularly beautiful, the Taj Majal can be very crowded. Also worth seeing in Agra is
                        the
                        Agra Fort, which is very similar to the Red Fort of Delhi. You can tour this 16th century fort
                        and
                        even explore the interior of its beautiful palace.

                        Northwest India is where you’ll find the state of Rajasthan, which borders Pakistan and is home
                        to
                        the Thar Desert. Whether you’re interested in Rajput history or views of the Aravallis
                        Mountains,
                        Rajasthan contains some of the best places to visit in India. Jaipur, or the Pink City, is the
                        capital of Rajasthan and a wonderful place to begin your trip.
